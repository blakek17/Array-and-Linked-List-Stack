# Array-and-Linked-List-Stack
Array-based and linked-list-based stack ADT classes and test program. Written in fall of 2019 as an academic project.

These programs were developed collaboratively with a fellow student as an academic project. show6.cpp and test6.cpp were provided by the instructor.

Description of files:
Stack.cpp and Stack.h contain the base class of the two stack implementations.
StackArray.cpp and StackArray.h contain the array implementation of a stack.
StackLinked.cpp and StackLinked.h contain the linked list implementation of a stack.
test6.cpp allows the user to interact with an instance of the stack.
show6.cpp visualizes the stack users are working with.
config.h controls which implementation of the stack is being tested.
